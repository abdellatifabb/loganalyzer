## Description

This project is a simple command-line log analyzer written in Python. It reads a plain‚Äêtext log file, counts how many lines contain the keywords `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR`, and writes those counts to an output summary file.

- `README.md`  
  This file, containing project details and usage instructions.
